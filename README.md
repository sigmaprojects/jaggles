# Jaggles (Java Aggregate Local Execution System)

All this program does is receive a task list from a MySQL datasource consisting of target Databases, Directories, SMB/CIFS locations, and Git urls to back them up locally.

This is a Java implementation of [Snaggles](https://github.com/sigmaprojects/snaggles)

## Getting Started

It's a maven project, built with IntelliJ IDEA.

### Prerequisites

There is a [distribution jar](https://github.com/sigmaprojects/jaggles/blob/master/target/Jaggles-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar), but you'll need to implement the database schema that controls it.
